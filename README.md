This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project for Coda, a workspace for classical musicians.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Supabase setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add the project URL and publishable key from Supabase.
2. Run `supabase/001_profiles.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor. It creates the protected `profiles` table and creates a profile automatically when a user signs up.
3. In Supabase Authentication settings, configure the site URL as `http://localhost:3000` for local development and enable email/password authentication.

The `/login` and `/signup` forms use Supabase Auth. New account names are stored in `auth.users` metadata and copied into `public.profiles` by the database trigger.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to optimize and load Manrope.
